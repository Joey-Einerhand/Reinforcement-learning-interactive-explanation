Step 1. Create a python virtual environment. Open a CMD window, navigate to the local copy of this repo on your PC, and run the command `py -m venv venv`. This creates a python virtual environment (and folder) called 'venv' in the repo.

Step 2. run the command `venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment.
